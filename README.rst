Dotfiles

Basic Information
=================
This package contains my dotfiles including my .vim and vim plugins (managed
with pathogen). To use the files just symlink the ones you want to your home
directory.  Some files have a hostname or distro appended to them of the form::

    .<dotfile>-<hostnameORdistro>

The purpose of this is to allow for different dotfiles on different machines
while still keeping it in version control. I might change this at a later date
to some sort folder structure.


Setup
=====

Run `./setup.sh`.
